# NodeJS Batch Resize Images

A super-fast and tiny script to resize or modify batches of images. Works with [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp).

## Install

* `npm install`

## Usage

* Put your images in `images/input`
* Eventually adapt the `index.js` script to your needs
* `node index.js`
* Resized files should appear in the `images/output` format
